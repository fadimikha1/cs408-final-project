# Grocery List CS408 Final Project

## Project Spec

This project's main theme will be a grocery list type of application where it will allow users to enter in what items they want their application to remember for them to buy, allow them to delete or mark off items, while also allowing them to view items that they have created or compelted from previous weeks. Essentially, it is a utility app for those people who need help remebering what to buy, but in a sense, it is so much more. The target audience in this cause will be the general public, but i am mostly creating this app for people who are orgnized and like to see their data and items at a glance. This application will handle a variety of user data, mainly including user inputed item names, values, and comments, meaning this will mostly handle text and double value inputs. There are 3 pages to this application. The initial page is a landing page here the user can load in the data from the database and see what is on their list, add and remove items, and just have a basic page where they can see all of their data. The next page is a page dedicated to completed items where the user can see their complete list and what items they have already gotten allowing them to comment on them and potentially change the item quanity's/price, and the last page will allow the user to browse through previous week's data to see what was on their lists. THe intial goal for this project is a relativley simple grocery list app, similar to a to do list, however, there are a lot of "stretch" goals that I am aming to achieve that will take this application and make it something that the general public will ctually find useful. The first stretch goal that I have listed, that i will most likely complete as it is basic to do, is to include a automatic tally that shows how much all of the unselected items that I have on my list cost, and if the user selects any specifc set of items, it will also show the total cost of all of the selected items, giving the user a basic idea as to how much money they need to bring if they only want a few items on their list, instead of all of them. The Next stretch goal will include having users be able to upload pictures so that users can see what the item that they are looking for actually looks like, a tool that could be incredibly useful in situations, for example, where a family member sends someone else to go buy something that the person has never heard of. It will be intresting to be able to figure out how to upload the pcitures and to match the data to the indivisual line item in the table. Overall, this project seems like it will be a very good learning expercience to be able to learn more about AWS and how to have a compelte full stack web development mindset as I honeslty have not had too much practice with this.
